## Feedback 

Great job on milestone1. you perfectly laid out the goal, purpose, and audience for the project. The persona was well written and helped me gain an understanding of what type of people will be interacting with the site. The use case perfectly lays out how users will be interacting with your site. The HTML is also perfect and so is your directory structure.

## Milestone 2α Feedback

Overall you did an excellent job on milestone 2α! Your wireframes are simple, and have a nice flow to them. You seem to have a clear understanding of what your 'client' wants, and that's extremely important when developing. 

One thing that immediately stood out to me, as well as the [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~mjordan30%2Fmy-pwp-bottomlineanalytics%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-2.php) was the meta tag for viewport. You included the following tag:
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">`, and I believe that's an autocomplete from Emmet in PHPStorm. Unfortunately, the user-scalable=no attribute does not allow the user to zoom in or out on the page, and by setting the max and min scale you're effectively taking all control away from your end users from a visual standpoint. After speaking to Rochelle and George about this, we agreed that the user-scalable, maximum-scale and minimum-scale attributes should all be removed.

I also noticed that you do not really have any photos designated within your wireframes. Is that intentional, or something to be added later? It's a personal preference, and you should always go with what your clients want, however, I find that a few good photos help break up a wall of text. Well divided sections also help break up the text nicely, so again, it's a personal preference.

Rochelle also pointed out that on your mobile wireframes you have a nav toggle and a horizontal nav. Rochelle recommended that you stick with the nav toggle (the button), because on a mobile device the horizontal nav menu won't consistently behave across devices and screen sizes.

I saw that Myra wanted a page dedicated to an amortization schedule among other 'tools', and was curious if you're going to include all of this on the home page, or if there will be multiple pages. If you're going to create more than one page I would recommend creating a wireframe for each additional page.
